# string format:allows you to format selected parts of a string.
# num1 = 3
# num2 = 10
# print("{} is smaller than {}".format(num1,num2))
# output:3 is smaller than 10
# num1 = 3
# num2 = 10
# text1 = "{} is smaller than {}"
# print(text1.format(num1,num2))
# output:3 is smaller than 10

# HOW TO USE STRING FORMAT:
# num = 150
# def myf():
#     print(f'print1:{num}')
# myf()
# print(f'print2:{num}')
# ouytput:rint1:150
# output:print2:150
